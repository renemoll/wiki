# Wireless Network Technologies


## Scratchpad

Goal: overview of wireless communication technologies

Topics of interest
* range (LOS, NLOS)
* data rate
* power consumption indication
* number of nodes per network
* security
* Reliability / QoS
* license

Note:
* physical layer
* data link
* media access
* ... (what do different technolgies provide?)

Use-cases
* gather information (sensors, monitoring)
* signal user/machine (trigger actions, alarms)
* firmware update (OTA updates)

### [Low-Power Wide-Area Networks: A Broad Overview of Its Different Aspects](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9848798)
* Low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs)


**One usefull grouping is in data rate vs range**
![Overview](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/mediastore/IEEE/content/media/6287639/9668973/9848798/cenke2-3196182-small.gif)

Low data rate & short range
* Bluetooth
* Thread
* zigbee
* RFID
* NFC

High data rate & short range
* WiFi

High data rate & long range
* Cellular (3G/4G/5G)

Low data rate & long range
* LoRa
* Sigfox
* LTE-M
* NB-IOT
* Z-wave
* 6LoWPAN

> TODO: , DECT NR, Zigbee mesh, BLE mesh ?

**Grouping by energy efficiency**

Energy efficiency (from high to low)
* LPWAN
  * Long Range (LoRa)
  * SigFox
  * Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT)
  * Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M)
  * Ingenu
  * Telensa
  * DASH7
  * Extended Coverage Global System for Mobile Communication (EC-GSM)
  * Weightless-N
  * Weightless-P
  * Weightless-W
  * IEEE 802.15.4k
  * IEEE 802.15.4g
* WSN
  * Zigbee
  * 6LowPAN
* Short range communication
  * Bluetooth
  * WiFi
* Cellular
