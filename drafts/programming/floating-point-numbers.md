# Floating point numbers


## The problem

```C
bool isEqual = fabs(f1 â€“ f2) <= epsilon;
```

* `FLT_EPSILON` is a standard define -> defines the difference between `1.0` and the next representable value.
* epsilon depends on the (difference of the) values you are comparing

Alternative: relative epsilon -> error as a max percentage of the differerence between 2 floats.
May require tweaking depending on the input.


## How to compare

* Comparing against zero? Absolute epsilon
* Comparing non-zero numbers? Relative epsilon or ULPs
* Comparing two numbers which could be zero and non-zero? ...


## Tooling

* compiler options?
* analysis tools?
