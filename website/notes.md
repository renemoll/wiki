# Notes - Website


# Generators

Currently using Jekyll, it works but is a little annoying due to maintainance of the build environment (security updates). Since I don't update a lot, my needs are simple:
1. simple to use and low learning curve.
1. no maintance on tooling.

1. [Jekyll vs Hugo vs Gatsby vs Next vs Zola vs Eleventy](https://mtm.dev/static)
1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
1. [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), [deploy action](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action)

I will give Zola a try.
