# On packaging

## pyproject.toml

A new file which specifies the build system to use when building your package ([PEP-0518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/)). 

**Using setup tools**
Specify the build system in `pyproject.toml` and configure the package meta-data in `setup.cfg`. The `setup.py` is not needed anymore.
