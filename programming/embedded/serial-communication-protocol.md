Synchronous serial communication
* Transmission/reception is synchronised
* Protocols
  * Byte-oriented
    * Synchronous transmit-receive (STR)
    * Binary Synchronous protocol (Bisync)
    * Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP)
  * Bit-oriented
    * Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) -> see HDLC (related)
    * High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
    * Logical Link Control (LLC)â€”IEEE 802.2
    * Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP) -> see HDLC (related).

Asynchronous serial communication
* Protocols
  *  PPP
  * High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)
  * Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP)

### UART & USART

USART: universal synchronous-asynchronous receiver transmitter
* Half-duplex
* Signals: TX, RX, CK (clock) (with optional XDIR - direction)
UART: universal asynchronous receiver transmitter
* Full-duplex
* Signal: TX, RX (with optional CTS/RTS/DE - clear to send/request to send/driver enable)


### High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)

Can be used in synchronsous (bit-oriented) and asynchronous mode (byte-oriented). This will focus on asynchronous mode.
* Used for point-to-point communicaiton (can also do mutlipoint).
* 2 control bytes (SOF=EOF & escape)
* Structure: SOF (1) - ADDR (1+) - CTRL (1 or 2) - DATA (n) - CHCK (2 or 4) - EOF (1) => overhead of 6-9 bytes
  > Note that ADDR is not optional (even in PPP communication)
* Control defines 3 types of packets: information (data), supervisory (flow/error control) and unnumbered (link management).

### Digital Data Communications Message Protocol (DDCMP)

* synchronous and asynchronous mode
* point-to-point and multipoint modes
