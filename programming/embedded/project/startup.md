# startup


Goal: start-up code

Must be:
* small footprint
* fast*
* readable/maintainable
* customizable

* fast is tricky on certain MCUs, especially the STM32F7 I am working with.

## Existing solutions

Cortex-M0/M0+/M1 -> ARMv6-M
Cortex-M3/M4/M7 -> ARMv7-M / ARMv7E-M
Cortex-M23/33/55/85 -> ARMv8-M

# Theory / background

Going through linkerscripts, and maybe even low-level initialization code provided by a libc implementations, you may run into the following

init: https://github.com/eblot/newlib/blob/master/newlib/libc/misc/init.c
fini: https://github.com/eblot/newlib/blob/master/newlib/libc/misc/fini.c

You may find resources discussion .ctors/dtors, crtbegin/crtend, crti/crtn...

And begin to wonder, what is all this, what is it for and is it even relevant?


All have to do with initialization before `main` is called and finalization after main returns.


There seem to be N groups:

- .ctors/.dtors -> list of constructors/destructors
- init/fini
- .init_array/.fini_array

> where does crtbegin/crtend, crti/crtn fit in?

[GCC intenals](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Initialization.html)
* The linker must build two lists of these functionsâ€”a list of initialization functions, called `__CTOR_LIST__`, and a list of termination functions, called `__DTOR_LIST__`.
Four variants:
#. arbitrary sections: on systems that support a .init section (`crtstuff.c `) (`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP`)
#. arbitrary sections:  the `__main` function is defined in `libgcc2.c` and runs the global constructors.
#. no arbitrary sections: fucntion pointer list in a special section (`TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR`)
#. no arbitrary sections: no special section: These functions are called via __main as described above. In order to use this method, use_collect2 must be defined in the target in config.gcc. 

target-def.h
#. `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION` / `CTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP` / `DTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP`
#. `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP`
#. `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP` = false, `TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR` list
#. `TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS` = false

* `TARGET_ASM_NAMED_SECTION`: no real effect
* `CTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP` / `DTORS_SECTION_ASM_OP`
* `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP`
* `TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR`
* `TARGET_HAVE_CTORS_DTORS`

* `USE_INITFINI_ARRAY`, when enabled:
  * disables:
    * `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP` / `FINI_SECTION_ASM_OP`
  * enables:
    * `INIT_ARRAY_SECTION_ASM_OP` / `FINI_ARRAY_SECTION_ASM_OP`
    * `TARGET_ASM_CONSTRUCTOR` / `TARGET_ASM_DESTRUCTOR`

* crti
  * `.init` section with `_init` function prelouge 



* crtn
  * `.fini` section with `_fini` function epilouge 



Before an application is executed, it may require initialization. Same when it terminates.

## How to trigger it

1. natural occourance
1. compiler arguments & extensions/attributes


* https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1386/6m7qcobkh/index.html#chapter2-48195
The registration of initialization and termination functions can be carried out directly by the link-editor using the -z initarray and -z finiarray options


## How to initialize it

Linker tags these sections with: DT_PREINIT_ARRAY and DT_PREINIT_ARRAYSZ, DT_INIT_ARRAY and DT_INIT_ARRAYSZ, and DT_FINI_ARRAY and DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ, DT_INIT and DT_FINI  (usefull?)

On a computer with an OS, the OS takes care of calling all the init/fini related code.

On a MCU we don't have that luxery. either we avoid needing this. or we perform the initialization.

## Thread local storage


.tbss
This section holds uninitialized thread-local data that contribute to the program's memory image. By definition, the system initializes the data with zeros when the data is instantiated for each new execution flow. The section occupies no file space, as indicated by the section type, SHT_NOBITS. Implementations need not support thread-local storage.
.tdata
This section holds initialized thread-local data that contributes to the program's memory image. A copy of its contents is instantiated by the system for each new execution flow. Implementations need not support thread-local storage.


# What happens before `main`

(intro: zoom in to MCU/ELF/RAM/FLASH)

Your application does not start with `main`. For C/C++ applications, `main` may be the main starting point, however there are things happening before and after. 

Even better, if you are working on bare-metal applications (like embedded), you don't even have to have a `main`.

* Working draft [C23](https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n3096.pdf)
  * section 5.1.2:
  > All objects with static storage duration shall be initialized (set to their initial values) before program startup. The manner and timing of such initialization are otherwise unspecified.
    * freestanding:
      * exeucting may take place without an operating system
      > the name and type of the function called at program startup are implementation-defined
      * library support may be limited, a certain set is required (Clause 4), the remaining is implementation-defined. [link](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding)
      * threads are implementation defined
    * hosted
      * start-up function calls `int main(void)` or `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`
      * complete library available (Clause 7)
      * may have multiple threads
* Working draft [C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/n4849.pdf)
 > 6.9.3.1: start-up contains the execution of constructors for objects of namespace scope with static storage duration; termination contains the execution of destructors for objects with static storage duration
  * 6.9.3.2:
    * Variables with static storage duration are initialized as a consequence of program initiation. Variables with thread storage duration are initialized as a consequence of thread execution.
    * Constant initialization is performed if a variable or temporary object with static or thread storage duration is constant-initialized (7.7). If constant initialization is not performed, a variable with static storage duration (6.7.5.1) or thread storage duration (6.7.5.2) is zero-initialized

From the above, we know:
* static variables need to be initialized: either zero or with a constant value.
* static object's constructors are to be executed

## How do we know what to initialize (and with what)?

After compilation and linking, we end up with an ELF file with various sections. A section can contains code, data (such as hard-coded values), debug information, and such. Two sections are of interest for data: `.bss` and `.data`. Both sections represent data used to initialize variables within an application. One for unitialized and one for initialized data.

Important: sections have two addresses:
* address in flash/on file
* address in memory

Meaning:
* `.bss` section needs to be filled with zeros (in RAM)
* `.data` needs to be copied (from FLASH to RAM)
